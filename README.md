# Deep-Learning

## Step 1: Preprocess the Data
Using your knowledge of Pandas and scikit-learn’s StandardScaler(), you’ll need to preprocess the dataset. This step prepares you for Step 2, where you'll compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model.

Start by uploading the starter file to Google Colab, then using the information we provided in the Challenge files, follow the instructions to complete the preprocessing steps.

Read in the charity_data.csv to a Pandas DataFrame, and be sure to identify the following in your dataset:
What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the feature(s) for your model?
Drop the EIN and NAME columns.

Determine the number of unique values for each column.

For columns that have more than 10 unique values, determine the number of data points for each unique value.

Use the number of data points for each unique value to pick a cutoff point to bin "rare" categorical variables together in a new value, Other, and then check if the binning was successful.

Use pd.get_dummies() to encode categorical variables.

Split the preprocessed data into a features array, X, and a target array, y. Use these arrays and the train_test_split function to split the data into training and testing datasets.

Scale the training and testing features datasets by creating a StandardScaler instance, fitting it to the training data, then using the transform function.
